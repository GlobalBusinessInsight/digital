Customer Acquisition in the AI Era: Just Do It!

Friends, good afternoon!
Everyone here today is in the B2B export business. You are our entrepreneurs, our foreign trade elites. I'm here today to talk about one thing, one topic that keeps every boss up at night—Customer Acquisition.
Especially these last few years. Do you all feel it? Is business getting harder? Are those inquiries from overseas getting harder and harder to get?
How did we do it in the past? We'd spend money to build a website, then we'd pour everything into SEO. We fought for rankings on Google. You're number one? I have to be number one ahead of you. We believed, as long as we ranked, the customers would come.
For the last ten years, that strategy worked.
But friends, the times have changed.

Please look at this number! 76%! In your target markets, more than three-quarters of your customers are no longer clicking on Google's search results one by one. What are they doing?
They're using ChatGPT. They're using Perplexity. They're using Google's AI Overviews.
They are "asking questions", and the AI is "giving answers"!

Let me ask you all a heart-piercing question: When the AI gives the customer a perfect, structured answer, why would they ever need to click on your website?
This is the "Zero-Click" era. This is the first massive shock AI has delivered to us.
In the past, our battlefield was called SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Today, a brand new, and much crueler, battlefield has arrived. It’s called AEO (AI Engine Optimization)!

I hear a lot of people saying, "AI is here, SEO is useless, SEO is dead."

I'm telling you, anyone who says that has completely failed to understand the future.
Not only is SEO not dead, it is your "entry ticket" to win the AEO battle!
Think about it. What is AI most afraid of? It's afraid of "AI Hallucinations." It's afraid of spouting nonsense. So how does it guarantee the answers it gives are accurate and credible?
It must learn from and cite those content sources that are truly professional, truly authoritative, and truly trustworthy.
At the same time, what is Google most afraid of? It's afraid of "spam content."
Have you noticed? AI and Google... they are afraid of the same thing. And so, they have given us one common standard, a golden standard for filtering "good content."
That standard is E-E-A-T!

Experience: Have you actually used the product? Are you a frontline expert? Where are your factory photos?
Expertise: Are you delivering "engineer-level" facts?
Authoritativeness: How many people in the industry are vouching for you?
Trustworthiness: Are you anonymous? Or do you dare to show your company address, your real identity?
Friends, this is the answer!
E-E-A-T is the one, and the only, "super fuel" for us to win both the SEO and the AEO battles at the same time!

If your content is just a pile of keywords for SEO, the AI will treat it as "garbage" and filter it out! If your content is a true "digital asset" that meets the E-E-A-T standard, the AI will treat it as a "bible"—learning from it first, citing it first!

So, our strategy becomes crystal clear.
In the AI era, we must be "dual-engine driven"! SEO is our "passive gravity field," making sure customers can find you in traditional search. AEO is our "authoritative citation source," making sure that when AI answers a question, it cites your opinion and recommends your company!

Okay, we have the concept. How do we execute? Do we have to go learn AEO, and E-E-A-T, and also SEO?
It's too complicated. Many of us bosses come from manufacturing. We build products. We don't get this.
It's okay. We have turned this complex logic into an extremely simple, turnkey solution.
We call it: "1+5+N"!

"1": One AI Marketing "Mothership" Website. This is your foundation, your digital asset hub. We build it with the strongest technical SEO standards to ensure it's loved by both Google and AI crawlers.
"5": Five Core Marketing Systems.
The AEO and SEO "dual engines" we just talked about.
Plus SEM (Ads), SNS (Social Media Matrix), and Video. These three are the "Global Accelerators"! What do they do? They build your reputation across the entire web. They build the "Authoritativeness" and "Experience" for your E-E-A-T!
"N": N AI-Powered Active Acquisition Tools.
We can't just "wait" for customers. We must "hunt" for them! We use AI to analyze data, use AI to make calls, use AI to send emails, and use LinkedIn for precision outreach.

You see? From "foundation" to "fuel," from "dual engines" to "accelerators," and finally to "active hunting." This is a complete, closed-loop combat system.
We've broken this complex system down into several packages, based on your company's stage of growth: UltraA, UltraB, UltraC, UltraX.
If you're just starting, you choose A. If you need to accelerate, you choose B or C. If you want to dominate the market, you go for X.
You don't need to hire a massive, internal IT and operations team. You just need to hand this "global acquisition" problem over to the people who are the most professional.

Friends, this is what we do. We, along with Alibaba and TikTok, were named to the "Top 50 Chinese Go-Global Service Providers."
Our understanding of AI, our understanding of overseas acquisition... it's all inside this "1+5+N" system.

The AI era isn't a question of "if" you should act. It's a question of "when." My answer is, Now! Immediately!
In the AI era, the competition is simple: You either go "All in," or you are "out."
Don't hesitate. Don't wait and see.

In the AI era, just do it!

Thank you!
