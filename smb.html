    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate Gray and Sage Green -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a formal analytical report. It begins with an executive summary and product positioning table. It then proceeds through a logical sequence of analysis: a quantitative cost comparison (TCO), a qualitative review of design philosophies, a detailed multi-dimensional feature comparison, and an analysis of each product's unique selling proposition. It concludes with a strategic summary. This structure mirrors a professional consulting report, guiding the user through a comprehensive and objective evaluation process, from high-level summary to detailed findings and strategic takeaways. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - TCO Calculator: Report Info -> Annual costs for 3 products based on user count. Goal -> Compare. Viz -> Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js) with a slider and a summary text block. Interaction -> User drags slider to see cost changes, text provides context. Justification -> This offers an objective, data-driven financial comparison that is both engaging and informative. Library -> Chart.js.
        - Positioning Table & Feature Tables: Report Info -> Tables from the source markdown. Goal -> Organize/Inform. Viz -> Clean, readable HTML tables. Interaction -> None. Justification -> Tables are the most effective way to present structured, comparative data clearly and concisely. Method -> HTML/Tailwind.
        - Core Philosophy Section: Report Info -> Each product's design philosophy. Goal -> Inform/Compare. Viz -> Three-column card layout. Interaction -> None needed. Justification -> Provides a quick, scannable overview of fundamental strategic differences. Method -> HTML/Tailwind.
        - USP & Conclusion Sections: Report Info -> Bullet points and summary text from the source. Goal -> Inform/Summarize. Viz -> Structured lists and text blocks. Interaction -> None. Justification -> This format is best for presenting analytical points and concluding remarks in a clear, hierarchical manner. Method -> HTML/Tailwind.

                <strong>Analysis Conclusion:</strong> In terms of pricing, the "unlimited users" and "fixed annual fee" model of ProcessGo Plus™ offers a significant cost advantage for growing teams. When a company's size exceeds 5-10 employees, its TCO becomes substantially lower than per-user pricing models like QuickBooks and Business Central. The latter, in addition to high licensing fees, also comes with extremely high implementation costs, making its first-year TCO far exceed the others.

                    <p class="text-slate-600">Its pricing strategy directly breaks the traditional SaaS model of per-user fees. For a growing team of 10 to 50 people, this means significant cost savings and high budget certainty.

                    <p class="text-slate-600">Unlike Business Central, which requires extensive consulting and customization to achieve process automation, the core value of ProcessGo Plus™ lies in its built-in, best-practice-based automated workflows.

ProcessGo Plus™ offers the perfect "upgrade path," achieving exponential efficiency gains at a similar or even lower total cost.</p>

                    <p class="text-slate-600">Its core advantage is offering **"just enough ERP capability without the complexity and high cost."** For the vast majority of SMBs, Business Central is overkill, with long implementation cycles and high risks. ProcessGo Plus™ provides the core ERP capabilities they need most, hitting pain points with its killer feature of "automation," delivering unparalleled value for money and a faster path to value realization.</p>
